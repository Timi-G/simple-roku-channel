1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,500
As autumn

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,166
approaches and the leaves blanket
the dirt road winding through Four Oaks.

3
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:06,791
The season changes on the farm.

4
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:10,291
The air turns crisp,
carrying the smoky scent of chimneys

5
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,583
and the mouthwatering aroma of homemade
cooking.

6
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,916
Chat and ribbit perched by a nearby tree.

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,833
Their eyes wide with curiosity, drawn
by the irresistible aroma of food.

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,333
Chat and ribbit quietly tiptoe inside.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,083
Through an open window of miracles.

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,000
Make sure you knead the dough firm.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,875
Meera helps her mother with baking.

12
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,916
She rested the dough roller down.

13
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,916
When she catches sight of her two
furry friends peeking

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,958
curiously around the corner,
Hi chat and ribbit.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,416
Why are you peeking around the corner?

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,416
Oh, you smell the food.

17
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,375
Well, it's Thanksgiving,
and it's a time to spend time

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,958
with family and to be grateful
for all that God has done for you.

19
00:00:56,958 --> 00:01:01,083
We still have a whole lot to cook
and we're running out of time.

20
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,583
Meera. Come here for a second. Gotta go.

21
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,708
Coming, mom.

22
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,875
We have to invite our friends.

23
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,875
chat and Rabbit busily assist
with Thanksgiving cooking

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,458
and then flitting and hopping about
as they spread the exciting news

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,750
to all their friends on the farm.

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,500
All the farm animals
happily make their way to Miracle's

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
house, ready
to celebrate with one another.

28
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,416
From the waddling pigs
to the trotting cows.

29
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,583
They eagerly follow the dirt road.

30
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,583
Excited to see
what the festive gathering has in store.

31
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:37,541
Hurry.

32
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,375
Let's not keep everyone waiting.

33
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:43,250
The animals gathered around the table
enjoying fresh apples, warm

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,250
bread and pumpkin pie.

35
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,541
As we are reminded in life.

36
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:57,000
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything
by prayer and supplication,

37
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,291
with thanksgiving,
let your requests be made known to God

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,958
and the peace of God,
which surpasses all understanding,

39
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,041
will guard your hearts
and minds through Christ Jesus.
